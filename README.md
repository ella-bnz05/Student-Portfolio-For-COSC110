## Table of Contents

- [Laboratory Activity 1: ](lab-act-1/lab1_titanic_BAÑEZ.ipynb) 
*Computational Thinking with the Titanic Dataset using Python* <br>
This activity applies computational thinking to analyze the Titanic dataset by breaking down the problem (decomposition), identifying trends like survival rates by class/gender (pattern recognition), focusing on key variables while ignoring noise (abstraction), and designing steps to process and visualize insights (algorithm design). 

- [Laboratory Activity 2: ](lab-act-2/lab2_titanic_BAEZ.ipynb) 
*Data Cleaning and Analysis using Titanic dataset* <br>
This activity introduces essential data cleaning techniques using Python and Pandas, covering key steps to prepare datasets for analysis.

- [Laboratory Activity 3: ](lab-act-3/lab3_intro_to_sympy_BAÑEZ.ipynb) 
*Introduction to SymPy* <br>
This activity demonstrates basic calculation using SymPy in Python, covering essential mathematical operations.

- [Laboratory Activity 4: ](lab-act-4/lab4_calculus_with_sympy_BAÑEZ.ipynb) 
*Exploring Calculus using SymPy* <br>
This activity demonstrates SymPy's calculus capabilities, covering limits, derivatives, and series expansions for symbolic computation.
