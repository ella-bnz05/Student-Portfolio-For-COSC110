# Laboratory Activity 3
Introduction to SymPy
 <br>

*The full code and step-by-step instructions are available in the Jupyter Notebook on this folder.*

## Objectives:
1.  Apply basic calculation using SymPy


## Tasks Performed:

**Task 1**  <br>
Importing of modules, it includes all necessary SymPy modules for symbolic computation <br>

**Task 2**  <br>
Performing exact calculations keeping symbols rather than decimal approximations. It shows how to solve arithmetic expressions with fractions and square roots. <br>

**Task 3** <br>
Creating symbolic variables using Symbols <br>

**Task 4** <br>
Simplifies algebraic expressions using simplify. <br>

**Task 5** <br>
Expands polynomial expressions using expand.
